Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install python-kafka, pymongo, configparser.

```bash
pip install python-kafka
pip install pymongo
pip install configparser
```

## Usage
```bash
cd kafka_unigap
./start_up.sh
```
## Note
The project is still in progress. When creating a consumer group with three consumers to read data from a remote Kafka, the process is not working. I will investigate and fix this issue.
